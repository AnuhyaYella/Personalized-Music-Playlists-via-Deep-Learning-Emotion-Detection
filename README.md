Personalized-Music-Playlists-via-Deep-Learning-Emotion-Detection

ðŸ“Œ Context
In today's digital age, music streaming platforms offer vast libraries of songs, but they often lack the ability to adapt to a listener's emotional state in real time. This project bridges that gap by integrating deep learning and computer vision to create a music player that responds to human emotions. By analyzing facial expressions through a webcam, the system detects the user's mood and automatically curates a playlist that resonates with their current emotional state. This not only enhances user experience but also introduces a therapeutic and immersive dimension to music consumption.
